to run the RN50 in the brainmri.yaml

use this configuration

model_name: RN50
layers_out: [1, 2, 3, 4]

What Is layers_out?

layers_out is a list of indices representing the stages (or blocks) of the ResNet50 model.
These indices correspond to the outputs of the major stages of the ResNet50 architecture.
How ResNet50 Is Structured:

ResNet50 is divided into 4 main stages (or blocks):
Stage 1: Output of layer1 (3 residual blocks).
Stage 2: Output of layer2 (4 residual blocks).
Stage 3: Output of layer3 (6 residual blocks).
Stage 4: Output of layer4 (3 residual blocks).

Then in each block, we have multiple conv layers.

here layers_out should not be confused with the conv layers.
These are the stages and each stage has different number of blocks.
